"""The common schema every source is normalized into before dedupe/split.

Binary ground truth only (`phishing` | `benign`) — that's what these public corpora actually
label; there's no public source for a `suspicious` middle class. Mapping to Aegis's runtime
three-way verdict is a concern for a later M3 stage, not corpus assembly.
