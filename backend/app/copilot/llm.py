"""LLM calls for the natural-language threat copilot — two isolated, monkeypatchable
call boundaries, mirroring app/reasoning/llm_analyst.py's shape exactly (so tests never
make a real network call, same as every other LLM-touching test in this repo).

`select_template` is a constrained tool-use call: `tool_choice={"type": "any"}` forces
Claude to return one of app.copilot.templates.TEMPLATE_REGISTRY's schemas — it cannot
respond with plain text, let alone free-form SQL. Its raw output is still never trusted
directly; app.api.routes.copilot always re-validates the (template_name, params) pair
through app.copilot.templates.execute_template's whitelist before anything runs.

`narrate` is a second, tool-free call that only ever sees the JSON the backend already
computed for one whitelisted query — it has no DB/tool access, so even a fully-manipulated
narration is a wording problem, never a data-leak one.

Defensive analysis only. Both functions degrade to None on any missing key or failure,
never raise — same resilience contract as llm_analyst.generate_analyst_narrative.
