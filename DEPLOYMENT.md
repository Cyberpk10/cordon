# Deploying Cordon to production

Backend → **Render** (Docker web service + managed Postgres). Frontend → **Vercel** (static Vite
build). This gets you a live HTTPS URL end to end. Follow the steps in order — the backend and
frontend each need the other's URL, so there's a short back-and-forth at steps 5 and 6.

## Before you start

- **Accounts**: GitHub (free), Render (free to create; the resources below cost money — see
  below), Vercel (you may already have one). Optionally an Anthropic API key if you want the LLM
  analyst narrative / copilot on in production — off by default, same as local dev. If you want
  email forwarding intake (M8 Stage 3), also a free Mailgun account — see step 8. If you want
  autonomous response to take real action in a customer's Microsoft 365 tenant (M6 Stage 2)
  rather than just simulating it, an Azure account to register one app in — see step 9; a free
  Microsoft 365 Developer Program tenant works for testing this live (see that section).
- **Cost**: this guide uses Render's **Starter** web service (~$7/mo, always-on) and **Basic-256mb**
  Postgres (~$6–7/mo, persistent) — roughly **$13–14/mo total**. Render also has free tiers for
  both (web service sleeps after 15 min idle; Postgres auto-deletes 30 days after creation) if
  you want to evaluate before paying — swap `plan: starter`/`plan: basic-256mb` in `render.yaml`
  for `plan: free` if so, and skip that database expiring being a problem for you. Confirm
  current prices at [render.com/pricing](https://render.com/pricing) before entering a card —
  they change over time. Vercel's Hobby plan (used below) is free.
- **No custom domain needed for the app itself** — Render and Vercel both give you free HTTPS on
  their own subdomains (`*.onrender.com` / `*.vercel.app`). Email forwarding intake (step 8) is
  the one exception: receiving mail requires MX records, which only work on a domain you actually
  control DNS for — not possible on a Render/Vercel-managed subdomain. Skip step 8 entirely if you
  don't need that feature yet; everything else works without it.

## 1. Push this repo to GitHub

Render builds from a connected GitHub repo. If this repo isn't on GitHub yet:

```bash
gh repo create cordon --private --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

(Or create the repo in the GitHub UI first, then `git remote add origin <url> && git push -u origin main`.)

## 2. (Optional) Test the Docker image locally first

Proves the container + migrations actually work before you pay for anything:

```bash
docker compose up -d db          # local Postgres, from the repo-root docker-compose.yml
docker build -t aegis-backend backend/
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://aegis:aegis@host.docker.internal:5432/aegis" \
  aegis-backend
```

Watch the logs for `alembic upgrade head` completing, then `curl http://localhost:8000/health` —
should return `{"status":"ok"}`.

## 3. Create the Render resources

**Recommended — Blueprint (one step, auto-wires the database URL):**

1. In the Render dashboard: **New +** → **Blueprint**.
2. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't, select the `cordon` repo.
3. Render reads `render.yaml` from the repo root and shows you the two resources it'll create
   (`aegis-db` Postgres, `aegis-backend` web service) — confirm the plans match what you want
   (Starter/Basic-256mb per above, or swap to `free` first if you changed the file).
4. It'll prompt you for the `sync: false` env vars (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
   `JWT_SECRET_KEY`) — leave `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as a placeholder like
   `https://placeholder.vercel.app` for now, you'll fix it in step 6. Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   blank unless you're enabling LLM features. For `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, generate a real random value
   — `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"` — and paste it in; this one
   isn't optional, since it's what signs every session token (see the auth note below).
5. Click through to create both resources.

**If the Blueprint import fails to parse** (Render's blueprint schema has changed over time —
`render.yaml` here matches the current documented format, but confirm against your dashboard if
it errors): create them manually instead —
1. **New +** → **PostgreSQL** → name it `aegis-db`, plan Basic-256mb, create it. Copy its
   **Internal Connection String** once it's provisioned.
2. **New +** → **Web Service** → connect the `cordon` repo → Runtime: **Docker** → Dockerfile
   path `backend/Dockerfile`, Docker context `backend` → plan Starter.
3. Under **Environment**, add: `DATABASE_URL` (the connection string you copied),
   `ENVIRONMENT=production`, `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://placeholder.vercel.app`
   (temporary), `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (a real random value — see step 4 above, this one's required),
   and optionally `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ENABLE_LLM_REASONING=true`/`ENABLE_COPILOT=true`.
4. Set **Health Check Path** to `/health`. Create the service.

## 4. Confirm the backend is live

Once the first deploy finishes, open the build/deploy logs and confirm you see `alembic upgrade
head` run without errors. Then:

```bash
curl https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/health
```

should return `{"status":"ok"}` over HTTPS. Note this URL — you need it in the next step.

## 5. Deploy the frontend to Vercel

A **new, separate** Vercel project (don't reuse an existing one you may have for another site):

```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel link          # creates a new project, follow the prompts
npx vercel env add VITE_API_BASE_URL production
# paste https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com when prompted (no trailing slash)
npx vercel --prod
```

Or via the dashboard: **Add New** → **Project** → import the repo, set **Root Directory** to
`frontend` (Vercel auto-detects Vite, no other config needed), add the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` env
var under Project Settings → Environment Variables, then deploy.

Note the resulting URL (`https://<project>.vercel.app`).

## 6. Lock CORS down to the real frontend URL

Back in Render, edit the `aegis-backend` web service's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var to the real
Vercel URL from step 5 (e.g. `https://aegis-frontend.vercel.app` — no trailing slash). Saving it
triggers an automatic redeploy.

## 7. Verify end to end

Open the Vercel URL in a browser:
- Confirm it loads over HTTPS and shows the Cordon login screen.
- Create an account through the onboarding screen (or sign in with one you already created via
  the API) — it should land on the dashboard with no CORS errors in the browser console
  (DevTools → Console/Network).
- `curl -I https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api/cases` from outside the browser should
  return `401` (confirms the backend itself, independent of CORS, is healthy and actually
  enforcing auth — a `200` here would mean routes aren't protected).

That's a live, HTTPS, production Cordon deployment.

## 8. (Optional) Email forwarding intake (M8 Stage 3) — Mailgun setup

**TODO: the only remaining manual step.** The backend code (webhook, signature verification,
account routing, forwarded-message unwrapping, dedup, rate limiting) is fully built, tested, and
already deployed — it's just inert (the endpoint 503s) until this section is completed. Nothing
below requires a code change, only a domain + Mailgun dashboard configuration.

Lets users forward suspicious emails to a per-account address (shown on the app's Settings tab)
instead of only uploading `.eml` files. Requires a domain you control DNS for.

1. Create a free [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) account (100 emails/day, 1 inbound route,
   no time limit — no credit card needed for the free tier at signup).
2. **Sending → Domains** → add a receiving subdomain, e.g. `in.<yourdomain>.com` (a subdomain,
   not your apex domain — keeps this fully isolated from any existing mail/DNS on the root
   domain). Mailgun shows you MX records to add; add them at your DNS provider and wait for
   verification (usually minutes, can take longer).
3. **Receiving → Routes** → create a route:
   - **Filter**: `match_recipient("^pilot-[a-z0-9]+@in\.<yourdomain>\.com$")` (swap in your real
     subdomain; this one regex matches every account's address, so you never touch this again as
     new accounts sign up).
   - **Action**: `forward("https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/api/inbound/email/mime")` — the
     `/mime` suffix is what makes Mailgun include the full raw original email (`body-mime`)
     instead of its own parsed-apart fields; without it the webhook still works but falls back to
     a lower-fidelity reconstruction (see `app.inbound.mailgun.extract_raw_email`).
4. **Sending → Webhooks** → copy the **HTTP webhook signing key** (this is *not* your API key —
   it's a separate value used only to verify inbound webhook authenticity).
5. On the Render service, set `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY` (the value from step 4) and
   `INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN` (the subdomain from step 2, e.g. `in.yourdomain.com`) — same
   `sync: false` prompt-for-value pattern as `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. Redeploy.
6. Verify: sign in to Cordon, open the **Settings** tab, copy the forwarding address shown there
   (`pilot-<token>@in.yourdomain.com`), and forward yourself a real (or sample) phishing email to
   it. A new Case should appear in the Cases tab within a few seconds. `curl -I
   https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/api/inbound/email/mime` (a bare GET, no valid payload)
   should return `405` (route exists, wrong method) rather than `404` — confirms the route is
   live even before you have a real forwarded email to test with.

## 9. (Optional) Real Microsoft 365 autonomous response — Azure app registration (M6 Stage 2)

Everything in this section is optional — every autonomy action (QUARANTINE_EMAIL/
DISABLE_SESSION/BLOCK_SENDER_DOMAIN) already works today via `MockConnector` (simulated, safe,
fully offline). This section is what upgrades a *specific connected account* to real actions
against its own Microsoft 365 tenant — nothing here affects any other account, and any account
that hasn't gone through this stays on MockConnector automatically.

**One app registration, shared across every future customer** — you do this once, not per
customer:

1. **Azure Portal → Entra ID → App registrations → New registration.**
   - Name: e.g. "Cordon Autonomous Response".
   - Supported account types: **Accounts in any organizational directory (multitenant)** — this
     lets the one app registration serve every future customer's tenant, not just your own.
   - No redirect URI — this is a daemon/client-credentials app, nothing signs in interactively.
2. **API permissions → Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Application permissions** (not
   delegated — there's no signed-in user), add `Mail.ReadWrite` (message search/move, inbox rule
   creation) and `User.RevokeSessions.All` (DISABLE_SESSION), then **Grant admin consent** — for
   your own tenant this is immediate; for a real future customer, this is the step *their*
   Global/Application Administrator does via this app's multitenant `/adminconsent` URL, not you.
3. **Certificates & secrets → New client secret** — copy the value immediately, it's shown once.
   This is `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. **Overview page** → copy **Application (client) ID** → `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`.
5. Set both on the Render service (same `sync: false` prompt-for-value pattern as
   `JWT_SECRET_KEY`), redeploy.

**Per account, once the app above exists** — connect a specific account's own tenant:

6. That customer's admin consents the app into their tenant (step 2's `/adminconsent` flow, or
   immediate if it's your own tenant).
7. `PUT /api/autonomy/graph-integration` (admin-only, authenticated) with `{"tenant_id": "<their
   Entra Directory (tenant) ID>"}`, found on that tenant's own Entra ID overview page. There's no
   frontend for this yet — use curl/Postman with the admin's bearer token. `GET
   /api/autonomy/graph-integration` confirms the connection.
8. From here, real actions only fire per the normal rules — policy level, confidence gate,
   exclusions, blast-radius cap all apply exactly as before. Nothing changes about *when* an
   action fires, only *what actually happens* when one does.

**Yes — a free Microsoft 365 Developer Program tenant works for testing this live.** Sign up at
[developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)
with a Microsoft account; it provisions a full E5-featured sandbox (Exchange Online + Entra ID —
everything needed here) with 25 user licenses, free, renews automatically for another 90 days as
long as you're actively using it. Billing info is requested for identity verification only, no
charge. Use that sandbox's own Directory (tenant) ID as the `tenant_id` in step 7, do the admin
consent (step 2) directly in that same tenant, then submit a real test phishing email addressed
to one of the sandbox's mailboxes and confirm it actually moves to a "Cordon Quarantine" folder.

## Notes for later

- `ENABLE_LLM_REASONING`/`ENABLE_COPILOT` are both off by default in `render.yaml`, matching
  local dev — turn them on (and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) once you've confirmed the base deploy
  works, not as part of the first deploy.
- Every subsequent push to the connected branch triggers a new Render build, which re-runs
  `alembic upgrade head` before starting — new migrations ship automatically on deploy.
- Logs: Render's dashboard log viewer captures stdout/stderr automatically, including uvicorn's
  per-request access log and anything from `logging` (level controlled by `LOG_LEVEL`).
- **Auth (M8 Stage 2)**: `JWT_SECRET_KEY` must stay the same value across restarts/redeploys —
  changing it (or leaving it unset, which falls back to a random per-process value) instantly
  invalidates every logged-in session. Password-reset and teammate-invite links are generated by
  the backend and returned directly in the API response rather than emailed (no email provider is
  wired up yet) — an admin can find/relay them via `GET /api/auth/users` and the invite/reset
  endpoints, or by looking at the `invite_link`/`reset_link` field in the API response.
- **Email forwarding intake (M8 Stage 3)**: forwarded-email analysis is best-effort for anything
  other than a `message/rfc822` attachment forward — a plain "hit Forward" in Gmail/Outlook/Apple
  Mail is text-marker-parsed, which recovers the original sender/subject/body but *not* the
  original `Authentication-Results` header (SPF/DKIM/DMARC-based indicators on those cases reflect
  the forwarder's mail server, not the original attacker's — see `app.inbound.unwrap`). A Case is
  deduplicated per-account by content hash, so retries or an accidental double-forward of the
  exact same email don't create duplicate Cases.
- **Real Microsoft Graph autonomy connector (M6 Stage 2)**: `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`/
  `_CLIENT_SECRET` are a single shared pair, not per-account — never rotate one without updating
  Render immediately, since every connected account's real actions break at once if it's stale.
  DISABLE_SESSION is `reversible=False` (there's no Graph API to un-revoke a session), so it
  always requires human approval before firing — it will never auto-execute at any policy level,
  by design, not a bug. A connector failure (expired consent, throttling, a message not found in
  the mailbox) is recorded as `status="execution_failed"` on the AutonomyAction row rather than
  crashing the request — check `GET /api/autonomy/actions` if a connected account's actions don't
  seem to be firing.
